.TH OBCPL 1
.SH NAME
obcpl \- BCPL compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B obcpl
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command
.I obcpl
is an interface to the BCPL toolchain, and invokes compiler
frontend, compiler backend, assembler, and linker in response to
options and filenames presented as arguments.
.PP
In determining how to deal with any particular file,
.I obcpl
considers the last portion of the filename:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
Files with names ending in `.b' are assumed to be BCPL source files,
and are processed starting at the frontend compilation stage.
.IP \(bu 4
Files with names ending in `.O' are assumed to be OCODE files,
and are processed starting at the backend compilation stage.
.IP \(bu 4
Files with names ending in `.s' are assumed to be assembly
language source files, and are processed starting at the
assembly stage.
.IP \(bu 4
Files with names ending in `.o' are assumed to be object files,
and are passed to the linker.
.RE
.PP
Processing can be stopped at the end of any particular phase
through the use of options.
Options
.BR \-C ,
.BR \-S ,
and
.B \-c
cause processing to stop after the OCODE generation phase, the
code generation phase, or the assembly phase, respectively.
For each input file, the result is written to a file of the same
name but with the suffix changed to `.O' or `.s' or `.o'.
.PP
.PP
The supported options are:
.TP
.B \-c
Stop after assembly.
.TP
.BI \-C
Stop after processing by compiler frontend.
.TP
.BI \-o output
Name the output file
.I output
rather than the default.
.TP
.B \-O
Enable optimisation.
.TP
.B \-S
Stop after processing by compiler backend.
