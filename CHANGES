OBCPL CHANGES


Release 0.9.8

This distribution is based on the 0.9.6 bcplkit release, but uses
a more capable compiler frontend and supplies a new x86 compiler
backend, together with a peephole optimizer, while dropping INTCODE
support.  Extensive revisions have been made to existing code.  New
features include GETVEC() and FREEVEC(), and better support for the
UNIX command line (ARGC, ARGV, PARAM) and for system error reporting
(RESULT2).
